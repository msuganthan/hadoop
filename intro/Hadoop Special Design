Hadoop Special Design:
======================

	On top existing hard-disk, we are going to install hadoop with HDFS. This HDFS was by default given some block size, i.e. 64 MB. or you can make it as 128MB also.

	Here we won't lose any block like normal hard-disk.

	Why is this design? Or Hadoop has to store more metadata.
